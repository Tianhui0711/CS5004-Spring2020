Good job on this Sentence Lab! All tests have been passed :) Here is some feedback.

1.Algorithm works well 

2.Overall comments make sense and look good.

3.In EmptyNode.java, IllegalArgumentException is thrown when a new word is added to an empty node, 
but actually it makes more sense to return a new word node or punctuation node for this function. 
Even Though an exception is expected to be thrown here, be careful using IllegalArgumentException. 
IllegalArgumentException should be thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or 
inappropriate argument(per api doc for IllegalArgumentException). Here, you may want to throw 
Exception("Cannot add a word to empty node") to better explain this situation.

4.Can you try to pass “String cargo” into the addback function? You may need to refer to the professor's 
example for more details such as adding a step to check cargo is a word or a punctuation.
