My idea for the final project is to build a personal blog with Java backend. As I am learning new things about computer science and programming, I think it is great to have an place to record my progress. Although there are many websites that can help you build a blog, building it myself is still a good practice to Java. Also, the blog can be updated and customized depends on my own interest.
