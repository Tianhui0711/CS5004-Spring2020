My idea for the final project is to build a web crawler with GUI for the website "XiaChuFang(下厨房)", which is a website about cooking and sharing recipes. The program will help people to design their daily meals, since we all stay at home these days and deciding what to cook is kind of a hard work for me.
The program will gather the recipes of breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert from this website, save them as csv files and randomly choose recipes to form today's daily meals. And then you don't need to worry about what to eat today!
