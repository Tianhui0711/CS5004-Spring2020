 * The program is a web crawler for the website "XiaChuFang(下厨房)", which is a website about cooking and
 * sharing recipes. The program will help people to design their daily diet, since we all stay at home these days and
 * deciding what to cook is kind of a hard work for me.
 * The program will gather the recipes of breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert in this website, save them as csv files
 * and randomly choose recipes to form a daily diet. And then you don't have to worry about what to eat today!
