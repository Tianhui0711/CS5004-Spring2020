Good job on this Fractions Lab! Here is some feedback on things to keep in mind.

1. When you are throwing exceptions, please ensure you are throwing the appropriate one. The fraction class should be 
throwing IlleagalArgumentException not IllegalAccess Exception. We are not trying to provide access to the fraction, 
it is trying to be set up with the incorrect arguments.

2. The requirements for toString asked for simplification of the fraction. If you expected the fraction to be already 
simplified, we would expect a comment stating that. If you ran out of time, a comment should state that simplification
is needed. If a requirement is not in your code or comments, reviewers are unaware if you saw the requirement.

3. Your equals function will not work if the fractions are the same unsimplified (aka 1/2 vs 4/8). They are technically equal.
However, if you interpret it to mean exactly the same, clarification should be provided in the comments.

4. During your addition method I was really looking for more comments in general. It took walking through your code to realize 
that you are completing simplification after the addition. However, great job going above and beyond the requirements. 
Simplification was not required for this method.

5. During testing, your catch statements should only print the error that was caught. If you print just a statement of the error 
you expected, you may miss a problem you were not anticipating. Use: System.out.println(e)

6. During testing, java's equals and assertEquals should not be used when comparing objects. The data/variables within should be 
compared. Try to use the toString or the equals method you wrote.

7. For code that may be used multiple times (simplification or cross multiplication) it is recommended to create another method. 
Your code only used each once, but each could be used in multiple places.
